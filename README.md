Week3-NSP

1. Importing Required Libraries:-

This section imports essential Python libraries required for data analysis and visualization:

pandas: For handling and analyzing tabular data.
numpy: For numerical operations (used internally by many libraries).
matplotlib.pyplot: For basic plotting.
seaborn: Built on matplotlib, used for advanced and styled visualizations.
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore'): Suppresses non-critical warning messages for cleaner output.

2. Loading the Dataset:-

This block loads the country_wise.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame called df. It then prints the column names to inspect the structure of the dataset and understand which columns are available for analysis.

3. Cleaning Column Names:-

Many CSV files contain unintended white spaces in column headers. This line removes any leading or trailing spaces from all column names to ensure accurate referencing and avoid KeyError when accessing columns.

4. Checking for Required Columns:-

This block checks if the essential columns needed for the analysis exist in the dataset. It provides a boolean-style check (Exists/Missing) for each column in required_cols, helping to validate dataset integrity before proceeding.

5. Identifying and Removing Missing Values:-

df.isnull().sum() counts and displays the number of missing values in each column.
df.dropna(inplace=True) removes any rows with missing values to prevent errors or biases during analysis.

6. Renaming Columns for Consistency and Readability:-

This block renames columns using more concise and readable names, like renaming 'Confirmed' to 'TotalCases' and 'Deaths' to 'TotalDeaths'. This makes the dataset easier to work with and improves clarity in visualizations.

7. Top 10 Countries by Total Confirmed Cases:-

This section sorts the dataset by TotalCases in descending order and selects the top 10 countries. It then visualizes these countries using a horizontal bar chart, helping to identify which countries are most affected by COVID-19.

8. Total Deaths vs. Total Recovered (Grouped Bar Chart):-

This block compares the number of total deaths and recoveries in the top 10 countries with the highest death counts. A grouped bar chart visually highlights the disparity between death and recovery numbers, giving a clearer picture of the crisis severity in those countries.

9. Indiaâ€™s COVID-19 Case Statistics:-

This code filters the dataset to show statistics specifically for India. It extracts India's total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases, then visualizes them using a vertical bar chart. This provides focused insight into India's national pandemic status.

10. Calculating and Visualizing Death Rate (%):-

Here, the script calculates the death rate for each country as a percentage of total confirmed cases. The top 10 countries with the highest death rates are then visualized using a bar chart. This helps in understanding how deadly the virus has been in different parts of the world relative to the infection rate.
